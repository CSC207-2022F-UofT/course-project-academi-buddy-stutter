**Top Priorities**
- Come to decision for Topics 3 and 4 update README accordingly
- Test Cases for things that are able to test without creating a new database. Mention which ones are not testable here
(In Topic 5: NOT TESTABLE area, please provide reasoning)
- Clean up code (400 errors)
- Resolve error in code


Topic 1: Different errors in code.
- Warning are the ones we have to fix. These include,
    - Easy to fix: redundancy, small class changes
    - Required discussion: repeated/identical classes, unused elements
    - Challenging: Class structure, data flow
Errors In Code:
- Interest tags seemed to have an error.

Topic 2: JavaDoc
- Should be easy, but time-consuming

Topic 3: User experience
- User logic error (Finding buddy by chance)

Topic 4: Potential Solutions for Topic 3
- Changing to sort by student courses instead of number of courses
- Changing interest tag names to general programs
- Displaying which courses are the same
- Select course searching
Any other ideas not implemented could be written on as future work
- Chat feature
- Recover password by sending a email to the address of their password
- Change password (generating code and emailing it)

Topic 5: NOT TESTABLE AREA (Please write down list of testcases and reasoning that they are not able to be implemented)
