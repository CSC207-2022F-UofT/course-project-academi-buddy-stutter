# CSC207 Group-106 "AcademiBuddy"

"ACADEMI BUDDY" is a program that allows similar interest users to connect with each other, based
on each individual's course schedule.

The user navigates through the program's UI, by the end, the program returns other students for the user to connect
with. The user will be presented with other profiles to access. The exact features and frames will be discussed later 
on.

## Program Workflow

![image](images/Class_workflow.png)

- This is how each class is organized and their relationships with each other


## Clean Architecture
- Dependency Matrix. Inner layer classes has no dependency on outer layer classes, or through an interface when an dependency is necessary. Note that the left most column represents the test package, not Launcher.

![image](images/Class_Dependency_Matrix.png)

-Flow of control. The frames play the role of both controllers and views here. All interactions between frames and models, input or output, are routed through the presenters (in other words, presenter is the io port of use case classes).

![image](images/Class_Dependency_Diagram.png)

- Softawre architecture is structured in a way that code encapsulates the user logic but keeps it separate from the delivery mechanism.

## SOLID Principle

**Single Responsibility Principle**

We left some unused variables in Course and Student classes and adapted our databases to them for future feature expansion.
Each use cases have its own presenter, frame, and manager, and if we need to use some feature or method across multiple use cases, we make a separate use case.

**Open-Closed Principle**

The project can be extended in many ways. For example, we used multiple interfaces throughout the project. If we decide to use another cloud service instead of Googleâ€™s firebase, say AWS, we can write an AmazonAPI and replace the FirebaseAPI, without having to change anything else. We can do the same for the local database in the same fashion.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**

Since we have different types of accounts, we made a user class. And made student and admin its child class, we made sure to call user instead of specific user type through our program whenever possible. And whenever we need to cast the user to a specific user type, we made sure to use a try-catch clause.

**Interface Segregation Principle**

We made sure all classes that implement an interface override all of the interface methods.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**

As the use cases have to depend on the database, we made an interface for the database classes to implement and made the use case classes depend on the interface instead. There are many examples of this beyond the database, for example, our Calendarinterpreter depends on an external library, so we made a ClaendarInterface and made a BiweeklyAPI to implement it and let CalendarInterpreter depend on the interface.

## Design Patterns

**Iterator Design Pattern: write,read counter**

We made write counter and read counter to record on firebase To increase efficeincy and runtime. In each counter there is integer count, whenever read or count occurs, they call the method call addCount method. Whenever we need to get count, we just call getCount.

**Dependency Injection Design Pattern: course class**

We created student objects outside and pass each student into course.

**Builder Design Pattern: LocalTempDataBuilder**

We used builder design pattern to create our local testing data. These data needs to be built in order and has fair amount of complexity since we need to add courses and students, and their friend request in right way.

**FaÃ§ade Design Pattern: FrameNavigator**

Each frame has a presenter and associated usecase. At first, to navigate a frame, we just initialized the frame presenter and created a frame. Then we found we could implement a Facade design pattern. FrameNavigator is created to initialize all UIPresenters, and implemented "faÃ§ade methods" to initialize frames.

Before:

`HomeUIPresenter homeUIPresenter = new HomeUIPresenter(database)`

`HomeFrame homeFrame = new HomeFrame(HomeUIPresenter)`

After:

`frameNavigator.toHome()`
